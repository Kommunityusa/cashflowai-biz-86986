# Security Fixes for Profile PII Protection

## Issue
The profiles table contained highly sensitive customer PII (Personal Identifiable Information) including full names, phone numbers, addresses, tax IDs, and payment information. While RLS policies existed, additional safeguards were needed to prevent potential data exposure.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Database-Level Protections

#### Ownership Validation Triggers
- **`enforce_profile_user_match()`**: Prevents users from creating or modifying profiles for other users
- Triggers fire on INSERT and UPDATE operations to validate `user_id` matches `auth.uid()`
- Raises exception if user attempts to access another user's profile

#### Audit Logging
- **`log_profile_changes()`**: Automatically logs all changes to sensitive fields
- Tracks modifications to: `tax_id`, `stripe_customer_id`, `paypal_subscription_id`
- Stored in `audit_logs` table for compliance and security monitoring

#### Security Functions
- **`is_own_profile()`**: Validates profile ownership (security definer function)
- **`get_profile_safe()`**: Returns profile data with sensitive fields redacted
- **`check_profile_access_rate()`**: Prevents enumeration attacks through rate limiting (10 queries/minute)

### 2. Application-Level Protections

#### Encryption for Sensitive Data (`src/utils/profileSecurity.ts`)
- **Tax ID Encryption**: All tax IDs are encrypted before storage using AES-256
- **Session-based Keys**: Encryption keys derived from user session tokens (not stored in browser)
- **Automatic Decryption**: Transparent decryption when loading profile data

#### Input Validation
- **`validateProfileAccess()`**: Ensures users can only access their own profiles
- **`validateProfileUpdate()`**: Whitelist validation of allowed profile fields
- **`sanitizeProfileForExternal()`**: Removes sensitive fields before external API calls

#### Code Updates
- **Settings.tsx**: Updated to use encryption utilities for tax_id field
- All profile queries validate user ownership before execution
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Sensitive data never logged to console in production

### 3. Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (database triggers, RLS, application validation)
✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
✅ **Audit Trail**: All sensitive changes logged for compliance
✅ **Encryption at Rest**: Tax IDs encrypted using session-derived keys
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and enumeration attacks
✅ **Input Validation**: Whitelisted fields prevent injection attacks
✅ **Secure Functions**: Security definer functions prevent RLS recursion

## Compliance & Regulatory

These measures help ensure compliance with:
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, encryption, audit trails
- **CCPA**: Data protection and access controls
- **SOC 2**: Access controls and audit logging
- **PCI DSS**: Encryption of cardholder data references

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test profile updates as different users
2. Verify tax_id encryption/decryption works correctly
3. Check audit logs are created for sensitive field changes
4. Test rate limiting by making rapid profile queries
5. Verify error messages don't expose sensitive information

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Field-level encryption for phone numbers and addresses
- Multi-factor authentication for profile changes
- Real-time anomaly detection for suspicious access patterns
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
